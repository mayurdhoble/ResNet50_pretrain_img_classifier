# ResNet50 Image Classification with Streamlit and TensorFlow/Keras

This project demonstrates an image classification application using a pre-trained ResNet50 model, built with Streamlit for the frontend and TensorFlow/Keras for the backend.

ResNet50 Model:

ResNet50 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with 50 layers, belonging to the Residual Network (ResNet) family. These models address the vanishing gradient problem, a challenge faced in deep neural networks, by introducing skip connections. These connections allow the network to learn complex functions while preserving information flow through the layers. ResNet50 is widely used for various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

ImageNet Dataset:

The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale image database containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of object categories. This pre-training provides the model with a strong foundation for image recognition, allowing it to be fine-tuned for specific classification tasks on different datasets.

Using the Application:

The application interface allows to upload an image and receive the model's classification prediction. The predicted class with the highest probability will be displayed.

The pre-trained model is designed for the ImageNet categories. Classification accuracy for custom datasets may vary.

This project provides a starting point for exploring image classification with pre-trained models. 


#This project leverages the power of Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and TensorFlow/Keras for robust deep learning capabilities, making image classification accessible and efficient.
